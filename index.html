Features ü§û üéÅ üôè
<a class=anchor href=#kernel-features--->#</a></h1><p>This is a list of kernel features that would be useful to have. The items on
the list are strictly ideas. It is especially important to not take the items
on this list as being implementation requests. Some of the ideas on this list
are rather rough and unrefined. They serve as entry points for exploring the
associated problem space.</p><p><strong>When implementing ideas on this list or ideas inspired by this list please
point that out explicitly and clearly in the associated patches and Cc
<code>Christian Brauner &lt;brauner (at) kernel (dot) org</code>.</strong></p><h3 id=inotify-events-for-bsd-file-locks>inotify() events for BSD file locks
<a class=anchor href=#inotify-events-for-bsd-file-locks>#</a></h3><p>BSD file locks (i.e. <code>flock()</code>, as opposed to POSIX <code>F_SETLK</code> and
friends are inode-focussed, hence would be great if one could get
asynchronous notification when they are released via inotify.</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> udevd probes block devices whenever they pop up to
create /dev/disk/by-label/* and similar symlinks. Formatting tools
can temporarily block this behaviour by taking a BSD file lock on
the block device (as per
<a href=https://systemd.io/BLOCK_DEVICE_LOCKING%29>https://systemd.io/BLOCK_DEVICE_LOCKING)</a>,
in order to make sure udevd doesn&rsquo;t probe file systems/partition
tables that are only partially initialized. Currently, udevd uses
inotify <code>IN_CLOSE_WRITE</code> notifications to detect whenever
applications close a block device after writing to it, and
automatically reprobes the device. This works reasonably OK given
that block devices are usually closed at the same time as their
BSD file lock is released, and vice versa. However, this is not
fully correct: what udevd actually should be watching is the locks
being released, not the devices being closed.</p><h3 id=auxiliary-socket-message-describing-the-senders-cgroup>Auxiliary socket message describing the sender&rsquo;s cgroup
<a class=anchor href=#auxiliary-socket-message-describing-the-senders-cgroup>#</a></h3><p><code>SCM_CGROUPID</code> or a similar auxiliary socket message, that allows
receivers to figure out which cgroup a sender is part of.</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> <code>systemd-journald</code> picks up cgroup information from
logging clients, in order to augment log records and allow
filtering via this meta-information. In particular it derives
service identity from that (so that requests such as &ldquo;Show me all
log messages of service X!&rdquo; can be answered). This is currently
racy, since it uses <code>SCM_CREDS</code>&rsquo; <code>.pid</code> field for this, which it then
used to load <code>/proc/$PID/cgroup</code>. In particular for programs that
log and immediately exit, the cgroup information frequently cannot
be acquired anymore by <code>systemd-journald</code>.</p><h3 id=linking-of-o_tmpfile-files-with-replacement>Linking of <code>O_TMPFILE</code> files with replacement
<a class=anchor href=#linking-of-o_tmpfile-files-with-replacement>#</a></h3><p>Ability to link an <code>O_TMPFILE</code> file into a directory while <em>replacing</em> an
existing file. (Currently there&rsquo;s only the ability to link it in, if the
file name doesn&rsquo;t exist yet.)</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> there are many programs (e.g. <code>systemd-hostnamed</code>
when updating <code>/etc/hostname</code>) that atomically want to update a
file, so that either the old or the new version is in place, but
never a partially updated one. The canonical way to do this is by
creating a temporary file with the new contents, and then renaming
it to the filename of the file to update, thus atomically replacing
it. Currently, the temporary file for this must be created with a
random name, <code>O_TMPFILE</code> cannot be used, since for these files
atomic-replace is not supported, currently.</p><h3 id=ability-to-only-open-regular-files>Ability to only open regular files
<a class=anchor href=#ability-to-only-open-regular-files>#</a></h3><p><code>O_REGULAR</code> (inspired by the existing <code>O_DIRECTORY</code> flag for
<code>open()</code>), which opens a file only if it is of type <code>S_IFREG</code>.</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> this would be very useful to write secure programs
that want to avoid being tricked into opening device nodes with
special semantics while thinking they operate on regular
files. This is particularly relevant as many device nodes (or even
FIFOs) come with blocking I/O (or even blocking <code>open()</code>!) by
default, which is not expected from regular files backed by &ldquo;fast&rdquo;
disk I/O. Consider implementation of a naive web browser which is
pointed to <code>file://dev/zero</code>, not expecting an endless amount of
data to read.</p><h3 id=unlinking-via-two-file-descriptors>Unlinking via two file descriptors
<a class=anchor href=#unlinking-via-two-file-descriptors>#</a></h3><p><code>unlinkat3(dir_fd, name, inode_fd)</code>: taking one file descriptor
for the directory to remove a file in, and another one referring
to the inode of the filename to remove. This call should only
succeed if the specified filename still refers to the specified
inode.</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> code that operates on a well-know path that might be
shared by multiple programs that jointly manage it might want to
safely remove a filename under the guarantee it still refers to
the expected inode. As a specific example, consider lock files,
that should be cleaned up only if they still refer to the assumed
owner&rsquo;s instance, but leave the file in place if another process
already took over the filename.</p><h3 id=determining-if-a-mount-point-belongs-to-the-current-user>Determining if a mount point belongs to the current user
<a class=anchor href=#determining-if-a-mount-point-belongs-to-the-current-user>#</a></h3><p>Ability to determine if a mount point belongs to the current user
namespace, in order to check if there&rsquo;s a chance a process can
safely unmount it (as that only works for mounts owned by the same
user namespaces ‚Äî or one further down the tree, but not any up the
tree). A simple, additional field in <code>/proc/self/mountinfo</code>
container the owning user namespace ID would probably already
suffice.</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> the <code>systemd</code> system and service manager tries to unmount
all established mounts on shutdown. Inside of container
environments where specific mounts are established by the
container manager (and not the payload itself) this will
ultimately fail if user namespaces are enabled. In order to clean
up the shutdown logic it would be very good to be able to
determine whether a specific mount could even possibly be
unmounted or whether it&rsquo;s not worth the effort to include the
unmount in the system shutdown transaction.</p><h3 id=read-only-propagation-of-mounts>Read-only propagation of mounts
<a class=anchor href=#read-only-propagation-of-mounts>#</a></h3><p>A way to mark mounts that receive mount propagation events from
elsewhere so that these propagated mounts are established
read-only implicitly. Right now, if a mount receives a mount
propagation event it will have the exact same <code>MS_RDONLY</code>,
<code>MS_NODEV</code>, ‚Ä¶ flags as it has where it originated. It would be
very useful if an <code>MS_RDONLY</code> could be ORed into the mount flags
automatically whenever propagated elsewhere.</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> various mount namespace based sandboxes
(e.g. <code>systemd</code>&rsquo;s <code>ProtectSystem=</code> option) mark large parts of the
host file hierarchy read-only via mounting it
<code>MS_RDONLY|MS_BIND|MS_REMOUNT</code>, but generally intend to leave the
file hierarchy besides that the way it is, and that includes they
typically still want to be able to receive mount events to
directories such as <code>/mnt/</code> and <code>/media/</code> in these sandboxed
environments. Right now, any such propagation then happens in
writable mode, even if the file hierarchy otherwise is almost
entirely read-only. To close this gap it would be great if such
propagated mounts could implicitly gain <code>MS_RDONLY</code> as they are
propagated.</p><h3 id=filtering-on-received-file-descriptors>Filtering on received file descriptors
<a class=anchor href=#filtering-on-received-file-descriptors>#</a></h3><p>An alternative to the previous item could be if some form of filtering
could be enforced on the file descriptors suitable for enqueuing on
the <code>AF_UNIX</code> socket. i.e. allow filtering by superblock type or
similar, so that policies such as &ldquo;only <code>memfd</code>s are OK to be
received&rdquo; may be expressed. (BPF?).</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> as above.</p><h3 id=excluding-processes-watched-via-pidfd-from-waitidp_all->Excluding processes watched via <code>pidfd</code> from <code>waitid(P_ALL, ‚Ä¶)</code>
<a class=anchor href=#excluding-processes-watched-via-pidfd-from-waitidp_all->#</a></h3><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> various programs use <code>waitid(P_ALL, ‚Ä¶)</code> to collect exit
information of exited child processes. In particular PID 1 and
processes using <code>PR_SET_CHILD_SUBREAPER</code> use this as they may
collect unexpected children that have been reparented from dying
sub-processes, and that need to be reaped in order to clean up the
PID space. Currently, these programs cannot easily mix waiting for
specific sub-processes via <code>pidfd</code> with waiting for the other
<em>unexpected</em> children via <code>waitid(P_ALL, ‚Ä¶)</code> since the latter also
reaps (and thus invalidates) the pidfd-tracked
children. Specifically, the <code>systemd</code> service manager would like
to use <code>pidfd</code>s to remove PID recycling security issues, but
currently cannot as it also needs to generically wait for such
unexpected children.</p><h3 id=asynchronous-close>Asynchronous <code>close()</code>
<a class=anchor href=#asynchronous-close>#</a></h3><p>An asynchronous or forced <code>close()</code>, that guarantees that
userspace doesn&rsquo;t have to risk blocking for longer periods of time
when trying to get rid of unwanted file descriptors, possibly
received via <code>recvmsg()</code> + <code>SCM_RIGHTS</code> (see above). Currently,
<code>close()</code> of various file descriptors (for example those referring
to slow storage, e.g. non-responding NFS servers and such) might
take arbitrary amounts of time, potentially into the minute range
and more. This makes it risky accepting file descriptors on
publicly accessible <code>AF_UNIX</code> sockets, the way like IPC brokers
(e.g. D-Bus) do it: if a rogue client keeps sending file
descriptors that because unexpected must be closed immediately it
might cause the receiving process to effectively crawl, when it is
busy closing them all. A special form of <code>close()</code> that simply
detaches a file descriptor from the file descriptor table without
blocking on IO in any form would be great to close this issue.</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> any program that receives file descriptors via <code>AF_UNIX</code>
from untrusted clients would benefit from this. e.g. D-Bus
brokers.</p><h3 id=clock_monotonic-network-timestamps><code>CLOCK_MONOTONIC</code> network timestamps
<a class=anchor href=#clock_monotonic-network-timestamps>#</a></h3><p>Currently network timestamps are exclusively in <code>CLOCK_REALTIME</code>, even
though for many (most?) a monotonic clock would be much preferable, as
calculations become easier when one doesn&rsquo;t have to think about clock
jumps and similar.</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> <code>systemd-journald</code> collects implicit timestamps via
<code>AF_UNIX</code> time-stamping, in <code>CLOCK_REALTIME</code>, even though for its
internal logic only monotonic timestamps are used, as log records
are searched via bisection in ordered tables, that require
strictly increasing timestamps. In particular during boot (where
<code>CLOCK_REALTIME</code> is often not available, stable or subject to
corrections) it would be good to have reliable, monotonic
timestamps on all log records.</p><h3 id=immutable-loopback-block-devices>Immutable loopback block devices
<a class=anchor href=#immutable-loopback-block-devices>#</a></h3><p>Truly immutable loopback block devices. Right now setting up a
loopback block device in read-only mode, backed by a read-only
file (stored on a regular read/write file system), and then
mounting it with <code>ext4</code> also in <code>MS_RDONLY</code>mode <em>will</em> result in
changes to the file, quite unexpectedly ü§Ø. Ideally, if a loopback
block device is set up in read-only mode this should guarantee
that the backing file remains unmodified by it.</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> disk image build tools that want to reproducibly and
verifiable build images must be able to rely that mounting them in
read-only mode does not alter the images in any way. In particular
when working in computer forensics one must be able to rely that
file systems that are analyzed remain unmodified by the analysis.</p><h3 id=a-timeout-for-the-flock-syscall>A timeout for the <code>flock()</code> syscall
<a class=anchor href=#a-timeout-for-the-flock-syscall>#</a></h3><p>A timeout for the <code>flock()</code> syscall. Faking the time-out in userspace
is nasty: most code does it with <code>alarm()</code> (or equivalent APIs), but
that&rsquo;s racy since on a heavily loaded system the timeout might trigger
before the <code>flock()</code> call is entered, in particular if short time-outs
shall be used. More accurate is to do the locking in a short-lived
child processed, but that&rsquo;s difficult already in C, and almost
impossible in languages that do not allow <code>fork()</code> without <code>execve()</code>.</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> as mentioned above systemd-udev allows synchronizing
block device probing via flock(). Often userspace wants to wait
for that, but without risking to hang forever.</p><h3 id=extend-mount_setattr-to-allow-changing-mount-properties-ignoring-any-failures>Extend <code>mount_setattr()</code> to allow changing mount properties ignoring any failures
<a class=anchor href=#extend-mount_setattr-to-allow-changing-mount-properties-ignoring-any-failures>#</a></h3><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> workloads that know that there are mounts in a mount tree
whose attributes cannot be changed by the caller don&rsquo;t want
<code>mount_settattr()</code> to fail on the first mount it failed to convert. Give
them a flag to request changes ignoring failures.</p><h3 id=upgrade-masks-in-openat2>Upgrade masks in <code>openat2()</code>
<a class=anchor href=#upgrade-masks-in-openat2>#</a></h3><p>Add upgrade masks to <code>openat2()</code>. Extend <code>struct open_how</code> to allow
restrict re-opening of file descriptors.</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> block services or containers from re-opening/upgrading an
<code>O_PATH</code> file descriptor through e.g. <code>/proc/&lt;pid>/fd/&lt;nr</code> as <code>O_WRONLY</code>.</p><h3 id=make-quotas-work-with-user-namespaces>Make quotas work with user namespaces
<a class=anchor href=#make-quotas-work-with-user-namespaces>#</a></h3><p>The quota codepaths in the kernel currently broken and inconsistent
and most interesting operations are guarded behind
<code>capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN)</code>, i.e., require <code>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</code> in the initial
user namespace. We should rework these codepaths to work with user
namespaces and then see whether we can make them work with idmapped
mounts.</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> using quotas correctly in containers.</p><h3 id=add-mount_setattr_locked-flag-to-mount_setattr>Add <code>MOUNT_SETATTR_LOCKED</code> flag to <code>mount_setattr()</code>
<a class=anchor href=#add-mount_setattr_locked-flag-to-mount_setattr>#</a></h3><p>Add a new <code>MOUNT_SETATTR_LOCKED</code> flag to <code>mount_setattr(..., ..., MOUNT_SETATTR_LOCKED, ..., ...)</code>.
The <code>MOUNT_SETATTR_LOCKED</code> flag allow a <code>ns_capable(mntns->user_ns, CAP_SYS_ADMIN)</code> caller to lock all mount properties. The mount properties
cannot be changed anymore.</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> allowing processes to lock mount properties even for
privileged processes. Locking mount properties would currently involve
having to have the mount namespace of the container be owned by an ancestor
user namespace. But this doesn&rsquo;t just lock a single mount or mount subtree
it locks all mounts in the mount namespace, i.e., the mount table cannot be
altered.</p><h3 id=extend-setns-to-allow-attaching-to-all-new-namespaces-of-a-process>Extend <code>setns()</code> to allow attaching to all new namespaces of a process
<a class=anchor href=#extend-setns-to-allow-attaching-to-all-new-namespaces-of-a-process>#</a></h3><p>Add an extension to <code>setns()</code> to allow attaching to all namespaces of
a process <code>SETNS_PIDFD_ALL</code> different from the caller&rsquo;s namespaces.
Currently specifying e.g., <code>CLONE_NEWUSER</code> fails if the caller is in the
same user namespace as the target process. This is very inconvenient.</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> Make it trivial to attach to all namespaces of a process
without having to figure out whether the caller is already in the same
namespace or not.</p><h3 id=security-hook-for-mount_setattr>Security hook for <code>mount_setattr()</code>
<a class=anchor href=#security-hook-for-mount_setattr>#</a></h3><p>(kAPI) Add security hook to <code>mount_setattr()</code>.</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> Allow LSMs to make decisions about what mount properties to
allow and what to deny.</p><h3 id=per-cgroup-limit-for-coredump-sizes>Per-cgroup limit for coredump sizes
<a class=anchor href=#per-cgroup-limit-for-coredump-sizes>#</a></h3><p>A per-cgroup knob for coredump sizes. Currently coredump size
control is strictly per process, and primarily under control of
the processes themselves. It would be good if we had a per-cgroup
knob instead, that is under control of the service manager.</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> coredumps can be heavy to generate. For different
usecases it would be good to be able to opt-in or opt-out

<a class=anchor href=#race-free-creation-and-opening-of-non-file-inodes>#</a></h3><p>A way to race-freely create an (non-file) inode and immediately
open it. For regular files we have open(O_CREAT) for creating a
new file inode, and returning a pinning fd to it. This is missing
for other inode types, such as directories, device nodes,
FIFOs. The lack of such functionality means that when populating a
directory tree there&rsquo;s always a race involved: the inodes first
need to be created, and then opened to adjust their
permissions/ownership/labels/timestamps/acls/xattrs/‚Ä¶, but in the
time window between the creation and the opening they might be
replaced by something else. Addressing this race without proper
APIs is possible (by immediately fstat()ing what was opened, to
verify that it has the right inode type), but difficult to get
right. Hence, mkdirat_fd() that creates a directory <em>and</em> returns
an O_DIRECTORY fd to it would be great. As would be mknodeat_fd()
that creates a device node, FIFO or (dead) socket and returns an
O_PATH fd to it. And of course symlinkat_fd() that creates a
symlink and returns an O_PATH fd to it.</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> any program that creates/unpacks not just files, but
directories, device nodes, fifos, and wants to ensure that they

65534:1000:1 50000:1000:1. This will only work if the mount is read-only as
the kernel wouldn&rsquo;t know what uid/gid would need to be put to disk
otherwise (65534? 50000? the first one that is mapped?).</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> Delegate multiple {g,u}ids to the same user. Merging
ownership similar to how overlayfs merges files. Bindfs

is to run <code>virsh</code> for VMs inside an unprivileged container. <code>virsh</code> or
libvirt creates device nodes, e.g., <code>/var/run/libvirt/qemu/11-fgfg.dev/null</code>
which currently fails in a non-initial userns, even if a cgroup device white

block device backing the root file system and other file systems
(Example: <code>systemd-gpt-auto-generator</code> or <code>bootctl</code> wull try to find
auxiliary file systems of the OS image by looking in the GPT
partition table the root file system is located in). While this
logic is good enough to find the backing block devices of some more
complex storage such as dm-crypt, dm-verity or btrfs, once
<code>overlayfs</code> is used as backing for the root file system this logic
does not work anymore. It would be great if there was an API to
simply query <code>overlayfs</code> for the superblock information
(i.e. <code>.st_dev</code>) of the backing layers.</p><h3 id=automatic-growing-of-btrfs-filesystems>Automatic growing of <code>btrfs</code> filesystems
<a class=anchor href=#automatic-growing-of-btrfs-filesystems>#</a></h3><p>An <em>auto-grow</em> feature in <code>btrfs</code> would be excellent.</p><p>If such a mode is enabled, <code>btrfs</code> would automatically grow a file
system up to the size of its backing block devices. Example: btrfs
is created with 200M in size on a block device 2G in size. Once the
file system is filled up fully, <code>btrfs</code> would automatically grow the
file system as need in the increments it needs, up to the 2G that
the backing block device is in size.</p><p><strong>Usecase:</strong> This would allow creating minimal, compact file
systems: just create them small on a sparse block device, and copy
files into it, as needed, create subvolumes and whatever else is
desired. As long as only files are created and written (but not
modified) the resulting fs should be automatically minimal in size.
This would specifically be useful in <code>systemd-homed</code>, which
maintains per-user <code>btrfs</code> file systems backed by block
devices. Currently, <code>homed</code> grows the file systems manually on login
and then shrinks them again on logout, but this is less than ideal,
since btrfs places files all over the backing store, and thus the
shrinking will generate a lot of nonsensical IO that could be
reduced if the file system was always kept minimal in size anyway.</p><h3 id=add-process-by-pidfd-to-a-cgroup>Add process by PIDFD to a cgroup
<a class=anchor href=#add-process-by-pidfd-to-a-cgroup>#</a></h3><p>At the moment the canonical way to add a process to a cgroup is by
echoing its PID into the <code>cgroup.procs</code> attribute in the target
cgroupfs directory of the cgroup. This is safe as long as the
process doing so just forked off the process it wants to migrate and
hence can control that it hasn&rsquo;t been reaped yet, and hence
guarantees the PID is valid. This is racy however if &ldquo;foreign&rdquo;
processes shall be moved into the cgroup.</p><p><strong>Usecase:</strong> In systemd, all user sessions are wrapped in scope
units which are backed by a cgroup. The session processes moved into
the scope unit are typically &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; processes, i.e. not children
of the service manager, hence doing the movement is subject to races
in case the process dies and its PID is quickly recycled. (This
assumes systemd can acquire a pidfd of the foreign process without
races, for example via <code>SCM_PIDFD</code> and <code>SO_PEERPIDFD</code> or similar.)</p><h3 id=ability-to-put-user-xattrs-on-s_ifsock-socket-entrypoint-inodes-in-the-file-system>Ability to put user xattrs on <code>S_IFSOCK</code> socket entrypoint inodes in the file system
<a class=anchor href=#ability-to-put-user-xattrs-on-s_ifsock-socket-entrypoint-inodes-in-the-file-system>#</a></h3><p>Currently, the kernel only allows extended attributes in the
<code>user.*</code> namespace to be attached to directory and regular file
inodes. It would be tremendously useful to allow them to be
associated with socket inodes, too.</p><p><strong>Usecase:</strong> There are two syslog RFCs in use today: RFC3164 and
RFC5424. <code>glibc</code>&rsquo;s <code>syslog()</code> API generates events close to the
former, but there are programs which would like to generate the
latter instead (as it supports structured logging). The two formats
are not backwards compatible: a client sending RFC5424 messages to a
server only understanding RFC3164 will cause an ugly mess. On Linux
there&rsquo;s only a single <code>/dev/log</code> AF_UNIX/SOCK_DGRAM socket backing
<code>syslog()</code>, which is used in a one-way, fire-and-forget style. This
means that feature negotation is not really possible within the
protocol. Various tools bind mount the socket inode into <code>chroot()</code>
and container environments, hence it would be fantastic to associate
supported feature information directly with the inode (and thus
outside of the protocol) to make it easy for clients to determine
which features are spoken on a socket, in a way that survives bind
mounts. Implementation idea would be that syslog daemons
implementing RFC5425 could simply set an xattr <code>user.rfc5424</code> to <code>1</code>
(or something like that) on the socket inode, and clearly inform
clients in a natural and simple way that they&rsquo;d be happy to parse
the newer format. Also see:
<a href=https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/19251>https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/19251</a> ‚Äì This idea could
also be extended to other sockets and other protocols: by setting
some extended attribute on a socket inodes, services could advertise
which protocols they support on them. For example D-Bus sockets
could carry <code>user.dbus</code> set to <code>1</code>, and Varlink sockets
<code>user.varlink</code> set to <code>1</code> and so on.</p><h3 id=open-thread-group-leader-via-pidfd_open>Open thread-group leader via <code>pidfd_open()</code>

to receive an <code>SCM_RIGHTS</code> fd the <code>SCM_RIGHTS</code> fd array will be cut
short at that point, and <code>MSG_CTRUNC</code> is set on return of
<code>recvmsg()</code>. This is highly problematic behaviour, because it leaves
the receiver wondering what happened. As per man page <code>MSG_CTRUNC</code> is
supposed to indicate that the control buffer was sized too short, but
suddenly a permission error might result in the exact same flag being
set. Moreover, the receiver has no chance to determine how many fds
got originally sent and how many were suppressed.</p><p>Ideas how to improve things:</p><ol><li><p>Maybe introduce a new flag <code>MSG_RIGHTS_DENIAL</code> or so which is set
on <code>recvmsg()</code> return, which tells us that fds where dropped from

a process makes the mistake of invoking <code>recvmsg()</code> on such a
socket. This is problematic since <code>SCM_RIGHTS</code> installs file
descriptors in the recipient process&rsquo; file descriptor
table. Getting rid of these file descriptors is not necessarily
easy, as they could refer to &ldquo;slow-to-close&rdquo; files (think: dirty
file descriptor referring to a file on an unresponsive NFS server,
or some device file descriptor), that might cause the recipient to
block for a longer time when it tries to them. Programs reading
from an <code>AF_UNIX</code> socket currently have three options:</p><ol><li><p>Never use <code>recvmsg()</code>, and stick to <code>read()</code>, <code>recv()</code> and
similar which do not install file descriptors in the recipients
file descriptor table.</p></li><li><p>Ignore the problem, and simply <code>close()</code> the received file descriptors
it didn&rsquo;t expect, thus possibly locking up for a longer time.</p></li><li><p>Fork off a thread that invokes <code>close()</code>, which mitigates the
risk of blocking, but still means a sender can cause resource
exhaustion in a recipient by flooding it with file descriptors,
as for each of them a thread needs to be spawned and a file
descriptor is taken while it is in the process of being closed.</p></li></ol><p>(Another option of course is to never talk <code>AF_UNIX</code> to peers that
are not trusted to not send unexpected file descriptors.)</p><p>A simple knob that allows turning off <code>SCM_RIGHTS</code> right reception
would be useful to close this weakness, and would allow
<code>recvmsg()</code> to be called without risking file descriptors to be
installed in the file descriptor table, and thus risking a
blocking <code>close()</code> or a form of potential resource exhaustion.</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> any program that uses <code>AF_UNIX</code> sockets and uses (or
would like to use) <code>recvmsg()</code> on it (which is useful to acquire
other metadata). Example: logging daemons that want to collect
timestamp or <code>SCM_CREDS</code> auxiliary data, or the D-Bus message
broker and suchlike.</p><h3 id=a-reliable-way-to-check-for-pid-namespacing>A reliable way to check for PID namespacing

current process is running in a PID namespace that is not the main
PID namespace. PID namespaces are probably the primary type of
namespace that identify a container environment. While many
heuristics exist to determine generically whether one is executed
inside a container, it would be good to have a correct,
well-defined way to determine this.</p><p><strong>üôá The inode number of the root PID namespace is fixed (0xEFFFFFFC)
and now considered API. It can be used to distinguish the root PID
namespace from all others. üôá</strong></p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> tools such as <code>systemd-detect-virt</code> exist to determine
container execution, but typically resolve to checking for
specific implementations. It would be much nicer and universally
applicable if such a check could be done generically. It would
probably suffice to provide an <code>ioctl()</code> call on the <code>pidns</code> file
descriptor that reveals this kind of information in some form.</p></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"><div><a class="flex align-center" href=https://github.com/uapi-group/kernel-features/edit/main/README.md target=_blank rel=noopener><img src=/kernel-features/svg/edit.svg class=book-icon alt=Edit>
