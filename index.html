<a class=anchor href=#kernel-features--->#</a></h1><p>This is a list of kernel features that would be useful to have. The items on
the list are strictly ideas. It is especially important to not take the items
on this list as being implementation requests. Some of the ideas on this list
are rather rough and unrefined. They serve as entry points for exploring the
associated problem space.</p><p><strong>When implementing ideas on this list or ideas inspired by this list please
point that out explicitly and clearly in the associated patches and Cc
<code>Christian Brauner &lt;brauner (at) kernel (dot) org</code>.</strong></p><ul><li><p>Ability to unmount obstructed mounts. (This means: you have a stack
of mounts on the very same inode, and you want to remove a mount in
the middle. Right now, you can only remove the topmost mount.)</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> this is useful for replacing mounts atomically, for
example for upgrading versioned disk images: first an old version
of the image is mounted. Then a new version is mounted over the
existing mount point, and then the lower mount point is
removed. One such software would be <code>systemd-sysext</code>.</p></li><li><p>Ability to mount sub-directories of regular file systems instead of
the top-level directory. i.e. for a file system <code>/dev/sda1</code> which
contains a sub-directory <code>/foobar</code> mount <code>/foobar</code> without having
to mount its parent directory first. Consider something like this:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>mount -t ext4 /dev/sda1 somedir/ -o subdir=/foobar
</code></pre><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> <code>systemd-homed</code> currently mounts a sub-directory of
the per-user LUKS volume as the user&rsquo;s home directory (and not the
root directory of the per-user LUKS volume&rsquo;s file system!), and in
order to implement this invisibly from the host side requires a
complex mount namespace exercise.</p></li><li><p>inotify() events for BSD file locks. BSD file locks
(i.e. <code>flock()</code>, as opposed to POSIX <code>F_SETLK</code> and friends are
inode-focussed, hence would be great if one could get asynchronous
notification when they are released via inotify.</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> udevd probes block devices whenever they pop up to
create /dev/disk/by-label/* and similar symlinks. Formatting tools
can temporarily block this behaviour by taking a BSD file lock on
the block device (as per
<a href=https://systemd.io/BLOCK_DEVICE_LOCKING%29>https://systemd.io/BLOCK_DEVICE_LOCKING)</a>,
in order to make sure udevd doesn&rsquo;t probe file systems/partition
tables that are only partially initialized. Currently, udevd uses
inotify <code>IN_CLOSE_WRITE</code> notifications to detect whenever
applications close a block device after writing to it, and
automatically reprobes the device. This works reasonably OK given
that block devices are usually closed at the same time as their
BSD file lock is released, and vice versa. However, this is not
fully correct: what udevd actually should be watching is the locks
being released, not the devices being closed.</p></li><li><p><code>SCM_CGROUP</code> or a similar auxiliary socket message, that allows
receivers to figure out which cgroup a sender is part of.</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> <code>systemd-journald</code> picks up cgroup information from
logging clients, in order to augment log records and allow
filtering via this meta-information. In particular it derives
service identity from that (so that requests such as &ldquo;Show me all
log messages of service X!&rdquo; can be answered). This is currently
racy, since it uses <code>SCM_CREDS</code>&rsquo; <code>.pid</code> field for this, which it then
used to load <code>/proc/$PID/cgroup</code>. In particular for programs that
log and immediately exit, the cgroup information frequently cannot
be acquired anymore by <code>systemd-journald</code>.</p></li><li><p><code>SCM_PIDFD</code> or similar auxiliary socket message, that is a modern
version of the <code>SCM_CREDS</code> message&rsquo;s <code>.pid</code> field, and provides a
<code>pidfd</code> file descriptor to the originating peer process.</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> security infrastructure (such as PolicyKit) can safely
reference clients this way without fearing PID
recycling. <code>systemd-journald</code> can acquire peer metadata this way in
a less racy fashion, in particular safe against PID recycling.</p></li><li><p>Ability to link an <code>O_TMPFILE</code> file into a directory while <em>replacing</em> an
existing file. (Currently there&rsquo;s only the ability to link it in, if the
file name doesn&rsquo;t exist yet.)</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> there are many programs (e.g. <code>systemd-hostnamed</code>
when updating <code>/etc/hostname</code>) that atomically want to update a
file, so that either the old or the new version is in place, but
never a partially updated one. The canonical way to do this is by
creating a temporary file with the new contents, and then renaming
it to the filename of the file to update, thus atomically replacing
it. Currently, the temporary file for this must be created with a
random name, <code>O_TMPFILE</code> cannot be used, since for these files
atomic-replace is not supported, currently.</p></li><li><p><code>O_REGULAR</code> (inspired by the existing <code>O_DIRECTORY</code> flag for
<code>open()</code>), which opens a file only if it is of type <code>S_IFREG</code>.</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> this would be very useful to write secure programs
that want to avoid being tricked into opening device nodes with
special semantics while thinking they operate on regular
files. This is particularly relevant as many device nodes (or even
FIFOs) come with blocking I/O (or even blocking <code>open()</code>!) by
default, which is not expected from regular files backed by &ldquo;fast&rdquo;
disk I/O. Consider implementation of a naive web browser which is
pointed to <code>file://dev/zero</code>, not expecting an endless amount of
data to read.</p></li><li><p><code>IP_UNICAST_IF</code> should be taken into account for routing decisions
at UDP <code>connect()</code> time (currently it isn&rsquo;t, only <code>SO_BINDTOINDEX</code>
is, but that does so much more than just that, and one often
doesn&rsquo;t want that)</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> DNS resolvers that associate DNS configuration with
specific network interfaces (example: <code>systemd-resolved</code>) typically
want to preferably route DNS traffic to the per-interface DNS
server via that interface, but not make further restrictions on the
origins or received replies, and all that without
privileges. <code>IP_UNICAST_IF</code> fulfills this role fine for TCP, but
for UDP it is not taken into account for the <code>connect()</code> routing
decision.</p></li><li><p><code>unlinkat3(dir_fd, name, inode_fd)</code>: taking one file descriptor
for the directory to remove a file in, and another one referring
to the inode of the filename to remove. This call should only
succeed if the specified filename still refers to the specified
inode.</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> code that operates on a well-know path that might be
shared by multiple programs that jointly manage it might want to
safely remove a filename under the guarantee it still refers to
the expected inode. As a specific example, consider lock files,
that should be cleaned up only if they still refer to the assumed
owner&rsquo;s instance, but leave the file in place if another process
already took over the filename.</p></li><li><p>Ability to determine if a mount point belongs to the current user
namespace, in order to check if there&rsquo;s a chance a process can
safely unmount it (as that only works for mounts owned by the same
user namespaces — or one further down the tree, but not any up the
tree). A simple, additional field in <code>/proc/self/mountinfo</code>
container the owning user namespace ID would probably already
suffice.</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> the <code>systemd</code> system and service manager tries to unmount
all established mounts on shutdown. Inside of container
environments where specific mounts are established by the
container manager (and not the payload itself) this will
ultimately fail if user namespaces are enabled. In order to clean
up the shutdown logic it would be very good to be able to
determine whether a specific mount could even possibly be
unmounted or whether it&rsquo;s not worth the effort to include the
unmount in the system shutdown transaction.</p></li><li><p>A way to mark mounts that receive mount propagation events from
elsewhere so that these propagated mounts are established
read-only implicitly. Right now, if a mount receives a mount
propagation event it will have the exact same <code>MS_RDONLY</code>,
<code>MS_NODEV</code>, … flags as it has where it originated. It would be
very useful if an <code>MS_RDONLY</code> could be ORed into the mount flags
automatically whenever propagated elsewhere.</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> various mount namespace based sandboxes
(e.g. <code>systemd</code>&rsquo;s <code>ProtectSystem=</code> option) mark large parts of the
host file hierarchy read-only via mounting it
<code>MS_RDONLY|MS_BIND|MS_REMOUNT</code>, but generally intend to leave the
file hierarchy besides that the way it is, and that includes they
typically still want to be able to receive mount events to
directories such as <code>/mnt/</code> and <code>/media/</code> in these sandboxed
environments. Right now, any such propagation then happens in
writable mode, even if the file hierarchy otherwise is almost
entirely read-only. To close this gap it would be great if such
propagated mounts could implicitly gain <code>MS_RDONLY</code> as they are
propagated.</p></li><li><p>Ability to turn off <code>SCM_RIGHTS</code> reception for <code>AF_UNIX</code>
sockets. Right now reception of file descriptors is always on when
a process makes the mistake of invoking <code>recvmsg()</code> on such a
socket. This is problematic since <code>SCM_RIGHTS</code> installs file
descriptors in the recipient process&rsquo; file descriptor
table. Getting rid of these file descriptors is not necessarily
easy, as they could refer to &ldquo;slow-to-close&rdquo; files (think: dirty
file descriptor referring to a file on an unresponsive NFS server,
or some device file descriptor), that might cause the recipient to
block for a longer time when it tries to them. Programs reading
from an <code>AF_UNIX</code> socket currently have three options:</p><ol><li><p>Never use <code>recvmsg()</code>, and stick to <code>read()</code>, <code>recv()</code> and
similar which do not install file descriptors in the recipients
file descriptor table.</p></li><li><p>Ignore the problem, and simply <code>close()</code> the received file descriptors
it didn&rsquo;t expect, thus possibly locking up for a longer time.</p></li><li><p>Fork off a thread that invokes <code>close()</code>, which mitigates the
risk of blocking, but still means a sender can cause resource
exhaustion in a recipient by flooding it with file descriptors,
as for each of them a thread needs to be spawned and a file
descriptor is taken while it is in the process of being closed.</p></li></ol><p>(Another option of course is to never talk <code>AF_UNIX</code> to peers that
are not trusted to not send unexpected file descriptors.)</p><p>A simple knob that allows turning off <code>SCM_RIGHTS</code> right reception
would be useful to close this weakness, and would allow
<code>recvmsg()</code> to be called without risking file descriptors to be
installed in the file descriptor table, and thus risking a
blocking <code>close()</code> or a form of potential resource exhaustion.</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> any program that uses <code>AF_UNIX</code> sockets and uses (or
would like to use) <code>recvmsg()</code> on it (which is useful to acquire
other metadata). Example: logging daemons that want to collect
timestamp or <code>SCM_CREDS</code> auxiliary data, or the D-Bus message
broker and suchlike.</p></li><li><p>Another alternative to this could be if some form of filtering
could be enforced on the file descriptors suitable for en-queuing
on the <code>AF_UNIX</code> socket. i.e. allow filtering by superblock type
or similar, so that policies such as &ldquo;only <code>memfd</code>s are OK to be
received&rdquo; may be expressed. (BPF?).</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> a above.</p></li><li><p>A reliable (non-heuristic) way to detect from userspace if the
current process is running in a PID namespace that is not the main
PID namespace. PID namespaces are probably the primary type of
namespace that identify a container environment. While many
heuristics exist to determine generically whether one is executed
inside a container, it would be good to have a correct,
well-defined way to determine this.</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> tools such as <code>systemd-detect-virt</code> exist to determine
container execution, but typically resolve to checking for
specific implementations. It would be much nicer and universally
applicable if such a check could be done generically. It would
probably suffice to provide an <code>ioctl()</code> call on the <code>pidns</code> file
descriptor that reveals this kind of information in some form.</p></li><li><p>A way to exclude <code>pidfd</code> watched processes from <code>waitid(P_ALL, …)</code>.</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> various programs use <code>waitid(P_ALL, …)</code> to collect exit
information of exited child processes. In particular PID 1 and
processes using <code>PR_SET_CHILD_SUBREAPER</code> use this as they may
collect unexpected children that have been reparented from dying
sub-processes, and that need to be reaped in order to clean up the
PID space. Currently, these programs cannot easily mix waiting for
specific sub-processes via <code>pidfd</code> with waiting for the other
<em>unexpected</em> children via <code>waitid(P_ALL, …)</code> since the latter also
reaps (and thus invalidates) the pidfd-tracked
children. Specifically, the <code>systemd</code> service manager would like
to use <code>pidfd</code>s to remove PID recycling security issues, but
currently cannot as it also needs to generically wait for such
unexpected children.</p></li><li><p>Mount notifications that do not require continuous re-scanning of
<code>/proc/self/mountinfo</code>. Currently, if a program wants to track
mounts established on the system it can receive <code>poll()</code>able
events via a file descriptor to <code>/proc/self/mountinfo</code>. When
receiving them it needs to rescan the file from the top and
compare it with the previous scan. This is both slow and
racy. It&rsquo;s slow on systems with a large number of mounts as the
cost for re-scanning the table has to be paid for every change to
the mount table. It&rsquo;s racy because quickly added and removed
mounts might not be noticed.</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> <code>systemd</code> tracks the mount table to integrate the mounts
into it own dependency management.</p></li><li><p>An asynchronous or forced <code>close()</code>, that guarantees that
userspace doesn&rsquo;t have to risk blocking for longer periods of time
when trying to get rid of unwanted file descriptors, possibly
received via <code>recvmsg()</code> + <code>SCM_RIGHTS</code> (see above). Currently,
<code>close()</code> of various file descriptors (for example those referring
to slow storage, e.g. non-responding NFS servers and such) might
take arbitrary amounts of time, potentially into the minute range
and more. This makes it risky accepting file descriptors on
publicly accessible <code>AF_UNIX</code> sockets, the way like IPC brokers
(e.g. D-Bus) do it: if a rogue client keeps sending file
descriptors that because unexpected must be closed immediately it
might cause the receiving process to effectively crawl, when it is
busy closing them all. A special form of <code>close()</code> that simply
detaches a file descriptor from the file descriptor table without
blocking on IO in any form would be great to close this issue.</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> any program that receives file descriptors via <code>AF_UNIX</code>
from untrusted clients would benefit from this. e.g. D-Bus
brokers.</p></li><li><p><code>CLOCK_MONOTONIC</code> network timestamps. Currently network timestamps
are exclusively in <code>CLOCK_REALTIME</code>, even though for many (most?)
a monotonic clock would be much preferable, as calculations become
easier when one doesn&rsquo;t have to think about clock jumps and
similar.</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> <code>systemd-journald</code> collects implicit timestamps via
<code>AF_UNIX</code> time-stamping, in <code>CLOCK_REALTIME</code>, even though for its
internal logic only monotonic timestamps are used, as log records
are searched via bisection in ordered tables, that require
strictly increasing timestamps. In particular during boot (where
<code>CLOCK_REALTIME</code> is often not available, stable or subject to
corrections) it would be good to have reliable, monotonic
timestamps on all log records.</p></li><li><p>Truly immutable loopback block devices. Right now setting up a
loopback block device in read-only mode, backed by a read-only
file (stored on a regular read/write file system), and then
mounting it with <code>ext4</code> also in <code>MS_RDONLY</code>mode <em>will</em> result in
changes to the file, quite unexpectedly 🤯. Ideally, if a loopback
block device is set up in read-only mode this should guarantee
that the backing file remains unmodified by it.</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> disk image build tools that want to reproducibly and
verifiable build images must be able to rely that mounting them in
read-only mode does not alter the images in any way. In particular
when working in computer forensics one must be able to rely that
file systems that are analyzed remain unmodified by the analysis.</p></li><li><p>A time-out for the flock() syscall. Faking the time-out in
userspace is nasty: most code does it with alarm() (or equivalent
APIs), but that&rsquo;s racy since on a heavily loaded system the
timeout might trigger before the flock() call is entered, in
particular if short time-outs shall be used. More accurate is to
do the locking in a short-lived child processed, but that&rsquo;s
difficult already in C, and almost impossible in languages that do
not allow fork() without execve().</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> as mentioned above systemd-udev allows synchronizing
block device probing via flock(). Often userspace wants to wait
for that, but without risking to hang forever.</p></li><li><p>Extend <code>mount_setattr()</code> to allow changing mount properties ignoring any
failures.</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> workloads that know that there are mounts in a mount tree
whose attributes cannot be changed by the caller don&rsquo;t want
<code>mount_settattr()</code> to fail on the first mount it failed to convert. Give
them a flag to request changes ignoring failures.</p></li><li><p>Add upgrade masks to <code>openat2()</code>. Extend <code>struct open_how</code> to allow
restrict re-opening of file descriptors.</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> block services or containers from re-opening/upgrading an
<code>O_PATH</code> file descriptor through e.g. <code>/proc/&lt;pid>/fd/&lt;nr</code> as <code>O_WRONLY</code>.</p></li><li><p>Implement a mount-specific companion to <code>statx()</code> that puts at least the
following information into <code>struct mount_info</code>:</p><ul><li>mount flags: <code>MOUNT_ATTR_RDONLY</code>, &mldr;</li><li>time flags: <code>MOUNT_ATTR_RELATIME</code>, &mldr;
Could probably be combined with mount flags.</li><li>propagation setting: <code>MS_SHARED)</code>, &mldr;</li><li>peer group</li><li>mnt id of the mount</li><li>mnt id of the mount&rsquo;s parent</li><li>owning userns</li></ul><p>There&rsquo;s a bit more advanced stuff systemd would really want but which
I think is misplaced in a mountinfo system call including:</p><ul><li>list of primary and auxiliary block device major/minor</li><li>diskseq value of those device nodes (This is a new block device feature
we added that allows preventing device recycling issues when e.g.
removing usb devices very quickly and is needed for udev.)</li><li>uuid/fsid</li><li>feature flags (<code>O_TMPFILE</code>, <code>RENAME_EXCHANGE</code> supported etc.)</li></ul><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> low-level userspace tools have to interact with advanced
mount information constantly. This is currently costly and brittel because
they have to go and parse <code>/proc/&lt;pid>/mountinfo</code>.</p></li><li><p>Make quotas work with user namespaces. The quota codepaths in the kernel
currently broken and inconsistent and most interesting operations are
guarded behind <code>capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN)</code>, i.e., require <code>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</code> in
the initial user namespace. We should rework these codepaths to work with
user namespaces and then see whether we can make them work with idmapped
mounts.</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> using quotas correctly in containers.</p></li><li><p>Add a new <code>MOUNT_SETATTR_LOCKED</code> flag to <code>mount_setattr(..., ..., MOUNT_SETATTR_LOCKED, ..., ...)</code>.
The <code>MOUNT_SETATTR_LOCKED</code> flag allow a <code>ns_capable(mntns->user_ns, CAP_SYS_ADMIN)</code> caller to lock all mount properties. The mount properties
cannot be changed anymore.</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> allowing processes to lock mount properties even for
privileged processes. Locking mount properties would currently involve
having to have the mount namespace of the container be owned by an ancestor
user namespace. But this doesn&rsquo;t just lock a single mount or mount subtree
it locks all mounts in the mount namespace, i.e., the mount table cannot be
altered.</p></li><li><p>Add a new <code>OPEN_TREE_CLEAR</code> flag to <code>open_tree()</code>. This flag can only be
used in conjunction with <code>OPEN_TREE_CLONE</code>. When specified it will clear
all mount properties from that mount including the mount&rsquo;s idmapping.
Requires the caller to be <code>ns_capable(mntns->user_ns)</code>. If idmapped mounts
are encountered the caller must be <code>ns_capable(sb->user_ns, CAP_SYS_ADMIN)</code>
in the filesystems user namespace.</p><p>Locked mount properties cannot be changed. A mount&rsquo;s idmapping becomes
locked if it propagates across user namespaces.</p><p>This is useful to get a new, clear mount and also allows the caller to
create a new detached mount with an idmapping attached to the mount. Iow,
the caller may idmap the mount afterwards.</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> A user may already use an idmapped mount for their home
directory. And once a mount has been idmapped the idmapping cannot be
changed anymore. This allows for simple semantics and allows to avoid
lifetime complexity in order to account for scenarios where concurrent
readers or writers might still use a given user namespace while it is about
to be changed.
But this poses a problem when the user wants to attach an idmapping to
a mount that is already idmapped. The new flag allows to solve this
problem. A sufficiently privileged user such as a container manager can
create a user namespace for the container which expresses the desired
ownership. Then they can create a new detached mount without any prior
mount properties via OPEN_TREE_CLEAR and then attach the idmapping to this
mount.</p></li><li><p>Enforce that the user namespace about to be attached to a mount must have
an idmapping written.</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> Tighten the semantics.</p></li><li><p>Add an extension to <code>setns()</code> to allow attaching to all namespaces of
a process <code>SETNS_PIDFD_ALL</code> different from the caller&rsquo;s namespaces.
Currently specifying e.g., <code>CLONE_NEWUSER</code> fails if the caller is in the
same user namespace as the target process. This is very inconvenient.</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> Make it trivial to attach to all namespaces of a process
without having to figure out whether the caller is already in the same
namespace or not.</p></li><li><p>(kAPI) Add security hook to <code>mount_setattr()</code>.</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> Allow LSMs to make decisions about what mount properties to
allow and what to deny.</p></li><li><p><input checked disabled type=checkbox> (kAPI) Add security hook to <code>create_user_ns()</code>.</p><p><strong>🙇 <code>7cd4c5c2101c ("security, lsm: Introduce security_create_user_ns()")</code> 🙇</strong></p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> Allow LSMs to monitor user namespace creation.</p></li><li><p>A per-cgroup knob for coredump sizes. Currently coredump size
control is strictly per process, and primarily under control of
the processes themselves. It would be good if we had a per-cgroup
knob instead, that is under control of the service manager.</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> coredumps can be heavy to generate. For different
usecases it would be good to be able to opt-in or opt-out
dynamically from coredumps for specific services, at runtime
without restarting them.</p></li><li><p>A way to race-freely create an (non-file) inode and immediately
open it. For regular files we have open(O_CREAT) for creating a
new file inode, and returning a pinning fd to it. This is missing
for other inode types, such as directories, device nodes,
FIFOs. The lack of such functionality means that when populating a
directory tree there&rsquo;s always a race involved: the inodes first
need to be created, and then opened to adjust their
permissions/ownership/labels/timestamps/acls/xattrs/…, but in the
time window between the creation and the opening they might be
replaced by something else. Addressing this race without proper
APIs is possible (by immediately fstat()ing what was opened, to
verify that it has the right inode type), but difficult to get
right. Hence, mkdirat_fd() that creates a directory <em>and</em> returns
an O_DIRECTORY fd to it would be great. As would be mknodeat_fd()
that creates a device node, FIFO or (dead) socket and returns an
O_PATH fd to it. And of course symlinkat_fd() that creates a
symlink and returns an O_PATH fd to it.</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> any program that creates/unpacks not just files, but
directories, device nodes, fifos, and wants to ensure that they
safely get the right attributes applied, even if other code might
simultaneously have access to the same directory tree.</p></li><li><p>The io_uring subsystem is open to adding classic existing synchronous
system calls (e.g. setns() or mount() or other) to io_uring. They also said
they would support adding new functionality into io_uring that is not
exposed through system calls yet.</p></li><li><p>Explore the idea of mapping different uids/gids to the same uids/gids, i.e.
65534:1000:1 50000:1000:1. This will only work if the mount is read-only as
the kernel wouldn&rsquo;t know what uid/gid would need to be put to disk
otherwise (65534? 50000? the first one that is mapped?).</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> Delegate multiple {g,u}ids to the same user. Merging
ownership similar to how overlayfs merges files. Bindfs
(
<a href=https://bindfs.org/docs/bindfs.1.html#sect3>https://bindfs.org/docs/bindfs.1.html#sect3</a>) allows this concept too.</p></li><li><p><a href=https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/concepts/filesystems/blobfs><code>blobfs</code></a>
for Linux. i.e. a minimalistic file system, that can store
authenticated (Verity) data files, that can be written once, and
not be modified after that, and provide stable handles (i.e. is
content-addressable) to them.</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> This would deliver just about enough to place
trusted OS resources (binaries, kernels, initrds, fs trees, other
resources) in them, without having to trust the medium and IO
underneath. Should be simple enough to even implement in a boot
loader and similar, without making things vulnerable to rogue file
system image attacks. The OS and its payloads (apps, containers,
…) could then be composed from these resources, through means like
overlayfs, namespacing and more.</p></li><li><p>Namespace-able loop and block devices, usable inside user namespaces.</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> Allow mounting images inside nspawn containers, and using
RootImage= and friends in the systemd user manager.</p></li><li><p><input checked disabled type=checkbox> Support idmapped mounts for tmpfs</p><p><strong>🙇 <code>7a80e5b8c6fa ("shmem: support idmapped mounts for tmpfs")</code> 🙇</strong></p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> Runtimes such as Kubernetes use a lot of <code>tmpfs</code> mounts of
individual files or directories to expose information to containers/pods.
Instead of having to change ownership permanently allow them to use an
idmapped mount instead.</p><p>@rata and @giuseppe brought this suggestion forward. For Kubernetes it is
sufficient to support idmapped mounts of <code>tmpfs</code> instances mounted in the
initial user namespace. However, in the future idmapped
mounts of <code>tmpfs</code> instances mounted in user namespaces should be supported.
Other container runtimes want to make use of this. The kernel is able to
support this since at least <code>5.17</code>.</p><p>Things to remember are that <code>tmpfs</code> mounts can serve as lower- or upper
layers in <code>overlayfs</code> and care needs to be taken that this remains safe if
idmapped mounts of <code>tmpfs</code> instances mounted in user namespaces are
supported.</p></li><li><p>Support detached mounts with <code>pivot_root()</code></p><p>The new rootfs must currently refer to an attached mount. This restriction
seems unnecessary. We should allow the new rootfs to refer to a detached
mount.</p><p>This will allow a service- or container manager to create a new rootfs as
a detached, private mount that isn&rsquo;t exposed anywhere in the filesystem and
then <code>pivot_root()</code> into it.</p><p>Since <code>pivot_root()</code> only takes path arguments the new rootfs would need to
be passed via <code>/proc/&lt;pid>/fd/&lt;nr></code>. In the long run we should add a new
<code>pivot_root()</code> syscall operating on file descriptors instead of paths.</p></li><li><p>Device cgroup guard to allow <code>mknod()</code> in non-initial userns</p><p>If a container manager restricts its unprivileged (user namespaced)
children by a device cgroup, it is not necessary to deny <code>mknod()</code>
anymore. Thus, user space applications may map devices on different
locations in the file system by using <code>mknod()</code> inside the container.</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> A use case for this, which is applied by users of GyroidOS,
is to run <code>virsh</code> for VMs inside an unprivileged container. <code>virsh</code> or
libvirt creates device nodes, e.g., <code>/var/run/libvirt/qemu/11-fgfg.dev/null</code>
which currently fails in a non-initial userns, even if a cgroup device white
list with the corresponding major, minor of <code>/dev/null</code> exists. Thus, in
this case the usual bind mounts or pre populated device nodes under <code>/dev</code>
are not sufficient.</p><p>An initial group internal RFC exists in
(
<a href=https://github.com/quitschbo/linux/tree/devcg_guard_rfc%29>https://github.com/quitschbo/linux/tree/devcg_guard_rfc)</a>.
See commit message for more implementation specific details.</p></li><li><p>Add <code>AT_EMPTY_PATH</code> support for unlinkat().</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> When dealing with files/directories, allow passing around only a
file descriptor without having to keep the path around to be able to unlink
the file/directory.</p></li><li><p>Race-free mount of block devices</p><p>Introduce a new struct to <code>fsconfig()</code> as an alternative to the
<code>source</code> property. The struct contains at least a pointer to a path,
possibly a device minor and major, and a diskseq number. The VFS can
expose a helper that filesystems can call and use the diskseq number
to verify that the block device they are intending to mount is indeed
the one they want to mount.</p><p><strong>Use-Case:</strong> Race-free mounting of block devices.</p></li></ul></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"><div><a class="flex align-center" href=https://github.com/uapi-group/kernel-features/edit/main/README.md target=_blank rel=noopener><img src=/kernel-features/svg/edit.svg class=book-icon alt=Edit>
